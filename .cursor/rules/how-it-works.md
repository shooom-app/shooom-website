# How-it-works guard
- Do NOT modify components/HowItWorksPuzzle.tsx or its icon-animation class names unless the user explicitly says "update How it works".
- Preserve classes: icon-neon, np-stroke, neon-search, neon-gps, neon-heart, sweep, spark, ring1/2/3, heart-fill, plus their keyframes (ns-sweep, gps-ping, heart-beat).
- Do not rename or remove the glass-shell / puzzle-* container classes and seam overlay.
